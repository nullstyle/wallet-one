# Wallet One - Experimental desktop Wallet for stellar.org

This project is a simple personal project to build a working desktop client for the stellar network using a set of technologies that are new to me, Scott Fleckenstein.  This is a learning project, for now, but if people are interested in helping to build this into a real product/project, I'm happy to contribute.

## Tech stack

This project is about exposing me to new tech:

- React is being used for building the UI
- Electron provides the app shell and the bindings between browser javascript and native code
- Material UI is used for the interface designs
- JSPM is being used to manage browser-side javascript dependencies

## Screenshots

Some in progress screenshots of the UI:
